Guidance  
Scaffold out the admin dashboard workflow using MVC with mock data  
What pages do you need?  
What data do you need to make each page function properly?  
What Data Models, Properties, Navigation Properties or DTOs do you need?  
An ERD is a great place to start  
Do you need any view models?  
Configure your core: DbContext with seed data, Interfaces/Services, Routing  

## Sprint 1 milestone 2

Work together with your partner(s) to complete this lab.  

NOTE: Your team workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. Azure DevOps CheatSheet  

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day’s milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, Communicate, and work together.  

Admin Dashboard  
Using Identity, Roles, and Policies, “protect” every screen and feature within the Admininistrative Dashboard so that only properly authenticated and authorized users have access to it.  

User Stories and Tasks  
Divide your work evenly amongst your team members.  

As the site owner, I would like to secure the admin dashboard so that only users with an administrative role can access it  
As an administrator I would like to ensure that only users with create permissions can add categories or products  
As an administrator I would like to ensure that only users with update permissions can modify categories or products

Admin Dashboard
When adding/editing products, we’ll be adding the ability to upload an image for each product. We’ll be storing these the cloud. Specifically, we’ll be using Azure Blob Storage Containers which allow us to upload an image to remote storage and obtain a URL so we can eventually view them on a web page.
